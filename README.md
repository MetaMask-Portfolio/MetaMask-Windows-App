# MetaMask Windows App: README

Welcome to the MetaMask Windows App! This software bridges the gap for Windows users who want to manage their MetaMask wallets directly from their desktop. With this app, you can securely manage your Ethereum assets, interact with decentralized applications (dApps), and enjoy the functionality of MetaMask in a native Windows environment.

# Important Notice

This software is **NOT an official MetaMask product**. It is an independent, third-party solution designed to provide Windows users with a desktop version of MetaMask until the official developers release one for Windows. MetaMask currently offers web browser extensions and mobile applications for Android and iOS, with plans to support Linux and macOS in the future.

While this application has been developed with security and usability in mind, users should:
  - Always download the app from trusted, official sources.
  - Carefully safeguard their wallet credentials.
  - Understand that the developers of this app are not affiliated with MetaMask or ConsenSys.
